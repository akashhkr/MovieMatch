# üé¨ MovieSwipe - Collaborative Movie Selection App

A Tinder-like movie selector designed for groups who can't decide what to watch together. Create or join rooms with friends, swipe through movies, and discover what everyone wants to watch through real-time collaborative matching.

## üéØ What is MovieSwipe?

MovieSwipe solves the age-old problem of "What should we watch tonight?" by gamifying the movie selection process. Instead of endless debates and indecision, users swipe through movie options in a fun, Tinder-style interface until they find films that everyone likes.
